# üìù Testing Documentation

## üìå Overview

This project implements API testing for the Lillian‚Äôs Candles backend, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our endpoints. We utilize a combination of xUnit, RestSharp, Fluent Assertions, and Allure to build a robust testing framework.

### üõ† Frameworks & Tools Used

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ xUnit (Test Framework)
Why xUnit?

xUnit is a widely used unit testing framework for .NET, providing lightweight and extensible test capabilities.

Pros:

- Built-in support for dependency injection.
Parallel test execution by default.

- Highly customizable through attributes like ```[Fact]```, ```[Theory]```, and ```[Trait]```.

Cons:

- Lacks built-in support for mocking (requires third-party libraries).

- May require additional setup for integration tests.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ RestSharp (API Testing Client)

Why RestSharp?

RestSharp simplifies HTTP client interactions for testing REST APIs.

Pros:

- Provides fluent syntax for making API requests.

- Supports async/await for non-blocking API calls.

- Easy serialization and deserialization of JSON.

Cons:

- No built-in assertions, requiring another assertion library (like Fluent Assertions).

- Some advanced HTTP features may require additional configuration.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fluent Assertions (Assertion Library)

Why Fluent Assertions?

This library enhances readability and debugging by allowing human-readable test assertions.

Pros:

- Clear and expressive syntax (e.g., response.StatusCode.Should().Be(HttpStatusCode.OK);).

- Supports rich comparisons (e.g., deep object equality, exception assertions).

Cons:

- Commercial licensing restrictions for business use.
- Can introduce breaking changes in updates.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Allure (Test Reporting)

Why Allure?

Allure provides rich visual test reports with detailed step execution logs.

Pros:

- Generates interactive, structured test reports.

- Supports step-based test execution visualization.

- Works well with xUnit and RestSharp.

Cons:

- Requires additional setup to integrate with xUnit.

- Patching issues with HarmonyLib in .NET 9.0 (causes warnings).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Testing

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Dependencies

To install the necessary testing packages, use:

```
dotnet add package xunit
dotnet add package xunit.runner.visualstudio
dotnet add package RestSharp
dotnet add package FluentAssertions
dotnet add package Allure.Xunit
```

Then, restore dependencies:

```
dotnet restore
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Writing Tests

Example API test using RestSharp, xUnit, Fluent Assertions, and Allure:

```
using System.Net;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using RestSharp;
using Xunit;
using FluentAssertions;
using Allure.Xunit.Attributes;
using Allure.Net.Commons;

namespace LilliansCandles.Tests
{
    [AllureParentSuite("Lillian's Candles API Testing")]
    public class ApiTests
    {
        private readonly RestClient _client = new RestClient("http://localhost:5124/api");

        [Fact(DisplayName = "GET /api/candles returns HTTP 200")]
        [AllureFeature("Get All Candles")]
        [AllureDescription("Verifies that the Get Candles endpoint returns a valid response.")]
        public async Task Get_Candles_ShouldReturn200()
        {
            // Arrange
            RestRequest request = new RestRequest("/candles", Method.Get);

            // Act
            RestResponse response = await _client.ExecuteAsync(request);

            // Assert
            response.StatusCode.Should().Be(HttpStatusCode.OK);
            response.Content.Should().NotBeNull();
        }
    }
}

### üöÄ Running Tests

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Standard Test Execution
Run all tests:

```dotnet test```

Generate a detailed test report with Allure:

```dotnet test --logger:trx```

### üêõ Troubleshooting & Issues Encountered

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fluent Assertions License Warning

Error Message:

```
The component "Fluent Assertions" is governed by the rules defined in the Xceed License Agreement.
Solution:
```

Can be ignored for non-commercial use.

Consider replacing Fluent Assertions with xUnit‚Äôs built-in assertions.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Allure.Xunit & HarmonyLib Incompatibility with .NET 9
Error Message:

```
Unable to patch XunitTestRunner's Void .ctor(...): System.MemberAccessException.
Issue:

Allure.Xunit uses HarmonyLib, which is not fully compatible with .NET 9.0.
Tests still pass, but Allure reports may be incomplete.
```

Solution Attempts: 

‚úÖ Tried setting:
```
export ALLURE_PATCH_XUNIT=false
```
‚úÖ Added:

```
Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("ALLURE_PATCH_XUNIT", "false");
```
üö® None of these fully resolved the issue, so we‚Äôre ignoring the warning for now.

## üìå Summary

What We Accomplished

‚úÖ Set up xUnit, RestSharp, Fluent Assertions, and Allure for API testing.

‚úÖ Wrote test cases to validate API responses.

‚úÖ Integrated Allure for reporting, despite warnings.

‚úÖ Documented known issues with Fluent Assertions licensing & HarmonyLib in .NET 9.
